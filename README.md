# High Performance Computing
5 problem sets of parallel programming on CPU and GPU. University projects for High Performance Computing Systems (Fall 2016).

## Description
Programmed with CUDA and C on GPU and CPU. Explored both homogeneous and heterogeneous parallel architects and introduced to performance measurement techniques, profiling, experimental evaluation of software interaction with underlying hardware and optimization.

#### Part 1: 
- Operator Sobel
- PSNR
- Code optimization: Loop interchange, loop unrolling, loop fusion, function inling, loop invariant code motion, common subexpression elimination, strength reduction
- Performance analysis and profiling

#### Part 2:
- OpenMP
- Multi-threaded CPU programming
- K-means clustering
- Performance analysis and profiling

#### Part 3:
- Convolution filter
- Tiling
- Divergences
- PTXAS

#### Part 4:
- Convolution
- Histogram
- Mapping

#### Part 5:
- Contrast enhancement
- Histogram equalization
